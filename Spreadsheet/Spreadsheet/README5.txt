    I found when debugging my dependencyGraph class that stresstest15 wont pass unless you add the elements to both
    stacks automatically so changing the test or telling future students they need to do this to not miss test points

    I didn't get 100% coverage because some of the branches shouldn't be visited unless something randomly goes wrong because
    the constructor checks for most cases.
